# CS50 Problem Sets Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Problem Sets from CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course (cs50.harvard.edu/x) and some of it contains the code from the syllabus of cs50 itself (i just retype it as a learning process).
And also some of my self exploration outside of cs50 itself

All solutions were completed by myself for educational purposes, in compliance with CS50's academic honesty policy.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Right now the folder structure is kinda messy, i folder it based on the name of problem set not by the week 

## Note:
Some of this project uses the CS50 Library, which is available in the CS50 IDE and Codespace environments.
Alternatively, it is recommended to run this project within the CS50 IDE or Codespace for convenience.
I will update as i progress through the course
