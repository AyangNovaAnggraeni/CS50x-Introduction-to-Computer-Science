sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: because it takes quicker on sorted data, since the omega(n) for bubble sort so it will
quicker in sorted data comparing to selection sort and merge sort

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: because it takes quciker on random data, since the omega(n log n) and O(n log n) for merge sort,
so merge sort takes quicker to sort random data

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: because it takes longer in every data (random, reversed,  and sorted) since the selecting sort has O(n^2)
and omega(n^2), it shows that selection sort takes much more running time than bubble sort and merge sort
